# Dotfiles

This repository contains the configuration files for various tools and application I use.

These are designed to work with macOS and Ubuntu, which are the primary environments I have tested.

[GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) is used for symlinking.


# Instalation

Run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/scebotari66/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
